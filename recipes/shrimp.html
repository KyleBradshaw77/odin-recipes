<h2>Southern Fried Shrimp</h2>

<p>Few things are more near and dear to Southerners' hearts than a big platter of fried shrimp. Crunchy, salty, and conveniently bite-sized, they're the chicken nuggets of the sea.</p>

  

<p>This recipe for Southern fried shrimp will be your new favorite, because we double-dredge them to deliver an extra-crunchy crust. You'll want to file the tartar sauce recipe away, too. Packed with pickles, briny capers, and chives, it's a fresh new twist you won't be able to resist.</p>

  

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

  

<p>All of these ingredients work together to create a full-flavored, balanced result. To make Southern fried shrimp, you'll need:</p>

  

<ul>

<li><strong>Canola oil</strong>: For frying the shrimp. Can substitute with other neutral oils with high smoke points.</li>

<li><strong>Mayonaise</strong>: The base of the creamy tartar sauce.</li>

<li><strong>Sweet Onion</strong>: Adds a sweetness, texture, and oniony flavor to the tartar sauce. </li>

<li><strong>Dill pickles and pickle juice</strong>: For a bright tanginess and acidity to balance the sauce.</li>

<li><strong>Capers</strong>: Add a briny flavor to the sauce that complements the shrimp.</li>

<li><strong>Chives</strong>: For a pop of color and mild oniony flavor.</li>

<li><strong>Stone-ground mustard: A hint of tangy, slightly spicy flavor.</li>

<li>Kosher salt: Enhances the overall flavor of the sauce and shrimp.</li>

<li><strong>Self-rising flour</strong>: To coat the shrimp before frying. Self-rising flour helps aerate the coating for a lightly crisp exterior. Substitute with other types of flours if needed, including all-purpose, rice flour, or cornmeal for a different texture.</li>

<li><strong>Creole seasoning</strong>: A rich blend of spices that flavors the shrimp coating.</li>

<li><strong>Black pepper</strong>: A hint of peppery spice.</li>

<li><strong>Whole milk</strong>: Helps two layers of flour adhere to the shrimp for a thick, crisp coating.

<li><strong>Hot sauce</strong>: Adds a spicy kick to the shrimp.</li>

<li><strong>Large eggs</strong> Helps bind the flour coating to the shrimp.</li>

<li><strong>Peeled, deveined raw shrimp, tail-on</strong> The star of the dish. Leaving the tails on the shrimp adds visual appeal. Opt for fresh shrimp if possible, or thaw frozen shrimp in a pinch.</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

<h3>Step 2</h3>

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the ground beef, stirring to crumble, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off the fat.

<h3>Step 3</h3>

To the skillet of ground beef, add the tomatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder. Simmer for 5 minutes.

<h3>Step 4</h3>

Place half of noodles in a lightly greased 12- x 8- x 2-inch baking dish, slightly overlapping lengthwise edges. Spoon one-third of the meat mixture over the noodles; add half of the shredded mozzarella, ricotta or cottage cheese, and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat layers, and spoon on the remaining meat mixture. Arrange the mozzarella slices on top. Cover the baking dish with foil. Bake at 350°F for 35 to 45 minutes. Remove the foil, and continue to bake for an additional 10 minutes.

<h3>Step 5</h3>

Let the finished dish rest for 10 minutes before serving. Top with chopped parsley, if desired.
